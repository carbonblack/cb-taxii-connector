# Enabling debugging will cause the service to not return when started.  To just get debug logging,
# use log_level=DEBUG instead.
#debug=True

# This is the log level that will be output to the log.  Default is INFO.
# Options are: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR

# If you need to use an HTTPS proxy to access the iSIGHT API server, uncomment and configure the https_proxy

# The location to store cached feed reports and temporary files
cache_folder=/usr/share/cb/integrations/cb-taxii-connector/cache

# Set this to true if you want the cache file to be formatted and easier to read.
# Warning! Enabling this will slow down the writing to disk by a magnitude of 10
#pretty_print_json=False

# If this option is set to true, it will cause the connector to not reach out to a CbResponse server to push
# sync requests and instead rely on the CbR Server to sync at it's regular schedule.
#skip_cb_sync=True

# Setting multi_core to True will use multiple processes for feed retrieval.  This has the effect of keeping
# memory usage low as the retrieval process ends after each retrieval returning used memory back to the OS.
# If this option is set to False, it will run multi-threaded which will have a larger memory footprint.
multi_core=False

# If this option is set to Stream (default), the feed will be written to file via a stream as it is retrieving the
# feed from the configured taxii servers.  This can use significantly less memory than Bulk.  If set to Bulk, the entire
# feed is read from the configured taxii servers before it is saved to disk.  With large feeds (>100,000 records) it is best to
# leave this option as Stream to reduce the memory footprint.
# Stream (default) - Saves to disk while retrieving data.
# Bulk - Saves at the end of the feed retrieval.
#feed_save_mode=Stream
